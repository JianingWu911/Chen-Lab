  description: "We present a design paradigm for soft pneumatic multimaterial actuators\
    \ by incorporating a stiffer material layer as a skeleton to softer inflated rubber.\
    \ A topology optimization-based framework is used to automatically generate the\
    \ skeleton layout, enabling desired motions like bending or twisting. Our approach\
    \ considers geometric and material nonlinearities, achieving high-performance\
    \ bending (73\xB0) and twisting (143\xB0) actuators. The design methodology offers\
    \ a rigorous and efficient solution for generating material layouts that deliver\
    \ spatially varying deformation upon actuation."

  description: Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are a promising actuation technology
    in soft robotics owing to their large voltage-induced deformation and rapid response.
    In this paper, we present an automatic design methodology to maximize the concerned
    displacement(s) of DEAs by topology optimization of the applied spatial electric
    fields (SEFs). We implement our method for motions of single and multiple degrees
    of freedom (DOFs) of planar DEAs, and the optimized SEFs have been found to improve
    the output displacements by more than 75% compared with their intuitive counterparts.
    Overall, our paper represents the first step toward automatic design of soft DEAs
    for diverse potential applications in soft machines and robots.

  description: The programmable actuation of DEAs along a predefined direction is
    challenging. In this paper, we provide an innovative solution to this problem
    by harnessing honeycomb metastructures to program the mechanical behavior of dielectric
    elastomers. To achieve uniaxial actuation and maximize its magnitude, we develop
    a finite element analysis model and study how the prestretch ratios and the honeycomb
    structuring tailor the voltage-induced deformation. We also provide a scalable
    fabrication solution by directly printing honeycomb lattices made of thermoplastic
    polyurethane on dielectric membranes with natural bonding. The preliminary experiments
    demonstrate that our designed DEA is able to undergo unidirectional motion, with
    the nominal strain reaching up to 15.8%.

  description: we present an integrated design strategy for planar DEAs, aiming to
    realize their full potential. To endow the actuator module with the maximal actuation
    strain, we carry out dimensionless analysis to identify the key design variables,
    develop a fast finite element analysis model, and thoroughly investigate how the
    geometric structuring and the material prestretch tailor the voltage-induced deformation.
    The experiments show that the optimized actuator obtains a remarkable nominal
    strain up to 38.6%. We also characterize the dynamic performance of the optimized
    actuator, evaluate its energy density and power density, and develop a soft locomotion
    robot that can crawl through a confined tunnel, at a fast moving speed up to 0.17
    body length/s.
