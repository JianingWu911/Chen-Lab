In the field of soft robotics, there is a lack of knowledge about design optimization methods, and that is exactly what we focus on. We are dedicated to exploring optimization methods, such as topological optimization, in the following three directions:

1. Aerodynamic shape design of soft robots: We aim to achieve freedom in shaping the outer surfaces of soft robots using optimization techniques.

2. Multi-material distribution design and control of anisotropic stiffness in soft robots: We work on optimizing the distribution of multiple materials within soft robots to achieve desired stiffness properties in different directions.

3. Integrated design of actuation and structure in dielectric-driven soft robots: We focus on the integrated design of the actuation mechanisms and structural components in soft robots driven by dielectric materials.

Our research in these areas aims to enhance the understanding and application of optimization methods in the design of soft robotics, addressing the challenges and possibilities in this field.
