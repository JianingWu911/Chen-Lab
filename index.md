We are dedicated to exploring optimization methods, such as topological optimization, in the following three directions:

## 1. Aerodynamic shape design of soft robots.

        <h2>Geometry Design, Optimization and Characterization of Soft Pneumatic Twisting Actuators</h2>
        <p>The aerodynamic shape design that breaks the current geometric constraints introduces parameterized freeform surfaces and integrates large deformation analysis with optimization algorithms, achieving pure torsional motion in a single material structure. Moreover, the output deformation and output torque significantly outperform existing designs.</p>
