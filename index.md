# WHERE SOFT MATERIALS AND ROBOTICS MEET
The Chen Lab is a team of researchers at the School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, dedicated to answering important questions in the design optimization of soft robots. We focus on driving mechanisms such as pneumatic and dielectric elastomers, and designing the optimal structure of soft robots through topological optimization.
