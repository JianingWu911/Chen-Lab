# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-feather-pointed" %} Aim
We are committed to integrating topology optimization methods with soft robot design, advancing the field of soft robotics.


# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-microscope" %} Research

We are dedicated to exploring optimization methods, such as topological optimization, in the following three directions:

1. Aerodynamic shape design of soft robots.

2. Multi-material distribution design and control of anisotropic stiffness in soft robots.

3. Integrated design of actuation and structure in dielectric-driven soft robots.
